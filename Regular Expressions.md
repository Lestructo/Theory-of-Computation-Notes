A Generalized Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (GNFA) is an NFA wherein the transition arrows may have any regular expression as labels (instead of only members of the alphabet or Î»)
- The start state has transition arrows going to every other state, but no arrows coming in from any other state.
- There is only a single accept state, and it has:
    - arrows coming in from every other state
    - no arrows going to any other state
    - qaccept does not equal qstart
- Except for qstart and accept, for every state:
    - one arrow goes from it to every other state
    - on arrow goes from it to itself
